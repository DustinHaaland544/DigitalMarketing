7. My team can help identify your MOST PROFITABLE course idea for you
8. Targeting "Under-Monetized" keywords on Youtube
9. The WORST mistake you can make is spending months working on something that no one wants
10. You need to VALIDATE your idea for a course, before you actually put anything together
11. See how many people are ALREADY LOOKING to spend money on this course!
12. The way we do this is by short-term Youtube video ads
13. Youtube has MILLIONS of "how to" videos that hungry buyers are watching...
14. KEYWORDS
15. Need to figure out/find out the best keywords those are getting most hits/searches
16. Your goal is to target people already looking to spend money on solving a specific problem...
17. "MICRO-NICHE" KEYWORDS ("How To" Keywords With Less Than 100k Searches)
18. KEYWORDS = $$$
  - Micro-niche keywords have less competition and as a result cost LESS for us to advertise under (higher profit)
  - Often times, many of these keywords have virtually ZERO other advertisers competing for this traffic!
19. Most Youtube advertisers over-emphasize targeting singular keyword phrases
20. If you saw a Youtube video with only 10,000 views you wouldn't think it was making much money...
21. KEYWORDS = $$$
  - The more "micro-niche" keywords you advertise under on Youtube then the more money you can make!
  - The reality is even the biggest advertisers overlook obvious micro-niche keywords (hint: they're lazy, uninformed, or both!)
22. I'm not over-simplifying when I say that targeting a few "micro-niche" keywords on Youtube can result in enough monthly profit
    to help you quit you 9-5 job...
23. The next step is creatng your Youtube video ad... Or as I like to call it...
24. Your "3 Minute Money Video"
25. To get started with it:
  - New Youtube Channel
  - Smartphone With Camera
  - Proven "3 Minute Money Script"
26. Do you need to be in the video?
  - No
27. Hire a professional, confident guy from Fiverr to be in your advertising video
28. Gimbal Stabilizer with Selfie Stick / ZHIYUN Stabilizer
29. The real key is AUTHENTICITY
30. Best of All: If someone skips your ad.... YOU DON'T PAY!
31. This means, when done correctly.... It is "literally IMPOSSIBLE to fail..."
32. Launching "Version 1.0"
33. Releasing Your "V1.0"
  - V1.0 = Your first version of your course
  - Same concept that companies like Uber and AirBNB launched with... start SMALL and release it to the market to get customer 
    feedback that informs your roadmap 
  - You can create your V1.0 course in less than 24 hours 
  - Price for $500-$2000 to start... increase with every new sale

42. FAQ:
  - How much do Youtube Ads cost?
    -> On average a "view" on your Youtube Video Ad will cost $0.05-$0.15
    -> We recommend having a minimum of $300-$500 to dedicate to your first targeting, and then simply re-inventing your profits back into more ads. 
    -> Youtube Ads are billed on a "daily" budget, meaning you do NOT need to shell out thousands of dollars upfront. I got started spending just $30 per day and reinvesting 
       my profits at the end of each week. 
  - How long does it take to Make profits?
    -> Depends on how quickly you want to make progress! Andrew made over $10000, in his first 14 days in getting started. However, the average from our experience is about 
       4-6 weeks. 
    -> The benefit with this model is it can work in the background of your daily life. So, after you set it up ONCE, it continues to pay you for months, and months to come, 
       completely passively. 
  - Why would people pay for a course when there's free information online? 
    -> For many people free blog posts and Youtube videos are fine. But for any "Big 4" problem there will always be a market of people willing to pay a premium to have it 
       solved FASTER, EASIER, or BETTER.
    -> In the modern world, there is an overflow of available INFORMATION and an overwhelming LACK of INSIGHT.
    -> If you have knowledge or a skillset in a "Big 4" category, I will virtually guarantee you could be earning 5-6 figures from it if you simply position it in the right way.
