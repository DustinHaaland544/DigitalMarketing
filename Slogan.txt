Are you looking to start something legitimate in the digital space but don't know where to start? I can help!
Hi, my name is Maimona Siddiqui. I was born in Karachi, Pakistan. I was a teacher in an International school in Saudia Arabia. Currently 
I am living in Canada with my husband and 3 kids for more than 7 years. I am a stay at home mom. My educational background is in psychology
but I never got a chance to work in my field due to personal commitments. I wanted to start something while staying home so I could support
my family and fulfill my dreams. I came across an ad similar to the one you are reading that led me to watch a complimentary 90 minutes 
webinar on how to start and build a successful digital business, and I realized this could be what I was looking for. With no prior 
experience, I took a leap of faith and started my own digital business.

This business is a complete plug 'n play package - it has a video based training, lifetime support by a professional mentor, a 
custom sales system, and the right mix of products.
I started my training while taking care of my household chores. I did not know much about the internet world. Thankfully, there 
is so much support in our community that even though it is my own business, I am never alone. 
There are no special skills needed except self-motivation and ambition. 
- No computer skills necessary
- No selling involved 
- Tax registered in Canada and 24 other countries
I now have the honor to inspire and help people from all walks of life to start this digital business and succeed in achieving their life goals. 
Success does not happen overnight. As long as there is a strong desire for a better life, someone who is coachable and puts in efforts, I can help!
It might or might not be for you, but at least give yourself a chance to check it out.
