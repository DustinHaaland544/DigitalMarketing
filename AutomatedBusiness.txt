Creating a truly automated business that generates income without your active involvement can be challenging but is achievable with the right strategies
and investments. Here are 10 automated business ideas that can potentially generate income while you're traveling or sleeping:

Dropshipping E-commerce Store: Set up an online store and partner with suppliers who handle product fulfillment. Use marketing automation tools to promote
products and manage customer inquiries.

Affiliate Marketing Website: Build a niche website or blog and promote affiliate products or services. Earn commissions for each sale or lead generated
through your referral links.

Print-on-Demand Merchandise: Create custom designs for apparel, mugs, phone cases, etc., and use a print-on-demand service to handle production and shipping.

Stock Photography: Upload your high-quality photos to stock photography websites, and earn royalties whenever someone purchases or licenses your images.

YouTube Channel: Create a YouTube channel around a specific niche or interest. Monetize it through ads, sponsorships, merchandise, and affiliate marketing.

Automated Blog with Ad Revenue: Write informative and evergreen content on a blog. Use SEO to attract organic traffic and monetize through ads, such as 
Google AdSense.

Mobile App Development: Develop a useful or entertaining mobile app and generate revenue through in-app ads, subscriptions, or in-app purchases.

Real Estate Investment: Invest in rental properties or real estate crowdfunding platforms that generate passive rental income and potential capital gains.

Dividend Stocks: Build a diversified portfolio of dividend-paying stocks. Over time, reinvest dividends to grow your holdings and generate passive income.

Automated Dropshipping Service: Create a service that helps others set up and manage their dropshipping stores, charging a fee or taking a percentage of
their sales.

Remember, while these businesses can generate passive income, they often require significant upfront effort, time, and sometimes capital to set up and maintain.
Additionally, they may not be entirely hands-off and may require occasional monitoring and adjustments. Always research and plan carefully before starting any 
automated business venture.
